## Architecture

### CI Pipeline
Here is my continuous integration and deployment pipeline

### Trello Project Tracking

Using Trello, I tracked my project along the way with a Kanban style board which allowed me to see my progress and things that need to be done.

## Risk Assessment

In my risk assessment I have listed possible risks with the project. I added the risks cause and effect as well as the likelihood of it happening, this is then followed by a control measure which can help negate the risk and give it a lower likelihood and consequence.

I then reviewed my risks towards the end of the project to see which control measures are implemented and whether I avoided those risks or not.

## Testing

In my inital testing to see the response code for my pages(home, about, addgames, games, review) to see if those pages are shown to the user. All the tests passed with a total coverage of 55%

Adding some more tests got me to 86% with more testing needed on forms and routes.

My final test coverage is at 89% with some website routes still needing testing. Tests have been made which add data to database and return the page with that data to show integration of databases.
